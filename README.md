Energetic Neutral Atoms Temperature Maps.

 Understanding the dynamics of the magnetotail both spatially and temporally is one of the biggest areas of research in space physics. How the energy transports from the tail side connection of the magnetic field all the way into the ionoshpere is crucial to understand this dynamics. Many challenges stand in the way of understand these various phenomena, not the least of which is the over reliance on in situ observations. Much of the progress made over the decades to resolve these issues revolves around having the various satellites being in the right place at the right time. This limitation slows down how much of the tail can be analyzed at a given time becuase almost all observations are localized and we rarely ever get a global context of these phenomena. Multi-point obeservations can offer some global view of the magnetotail but the coordination required to get a global context of an event is a challenge. Simulations have been used to bridge this gap, but that also relies on in situ measurements both for inputs into the algorithm and also for validation of the results. 
 Having a global view of the magnetotial can give another avenue of observing and analyzing the magnetotail and putting in situ measurements into a global context. This is where a temeprature map of the magnetotail comes into play [Keesee et. al, 2008 (10.1029/2008JA013130)]. This technique makes use of energetic neutral atoms (ENA) to image the magnetotial. ENAs are created from charge exchange collisions of energetic ions with cold neutrals. The collision causes the eneretic ions to gain an electron from the cold neutral and become a neutral itself. Little loss of information is lost in this process due to the energy difference between the cold neutral and the energetic ion. The little loss of information ensures that the newly formed energetic neutral still keeps the properties (majority of it at least) of the parent ion population. Being neutrals, they can be measured remotely from distant satellites like the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers (TWINS) and used as a proxy for getting information about the parent ion population. The measured ENAs can then be projected back down into the equatorial plane as a function of several properties of the parent ions, in this case, the temperature. This process creates an ENA temeperature map of the magnetotail. The full details of the techniques can be seen in the paper linked above.
